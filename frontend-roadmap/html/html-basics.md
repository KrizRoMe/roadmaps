# üìÉ HTML Basics

## What is HTML? (Hypert Text Mark Language)?

- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web Pages.
- HTML describes a structure of a Web Page.
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is paragraph", "this is a heading", "this is a link", etc.
- üëÄ Tags are not case-sensitive.
- üìù The W3C recommends writing all tags in lowercase.

## What is a Tag?

- A tag is a keyword surrounded by angle brackets, like `<html>`.
- Most tags must be opened `<html>` and closed `</html>`.
- üëÄ Elements of a single tag are called <strong>void elements<strong/>.

## Attributes

- Provide additional information about an element.
- For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces.
- The attribute , followed by an equal sign
- An attribute value, wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
- Boolean can only have one value, wich is generally the same as the attribute name.
- The boolean attribute is considered to be true if the attribute is present on the element, regardless of the value.


## Single or double quotes?

- The HTML standard does not care if you use single or double quotes.
- Make sure you don't mix single and double quotes in the same document.
- However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type inside the attribute value.

## Character References

```html
